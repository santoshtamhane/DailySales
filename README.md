# Ionic and Firebase Authentication Starter

This is an authentication starter template built with Ionic and Firebase. It's using Angular as the programming framework.

## Packages

It's using:

- `@angular`: "~8.1.2"
- `@angular/fire`: "^5.2.1"
- `@ionic/angular`: "^4.7.1"
- `firebase`: "^6.3.3"
- `rxjs`: "~6.5.1"

I'll do my best to update the `README` when I update those packages.

## Contents

This starter templates has:

- Login Page
- Signup Page
- Reset Password Page
- Profile Page

It extracts the common login/signup/reset functionality into an authentication component that creates the authentication form and passes the user credentials to the parent component (_either Login, Signup, or ResetPassword_).

## Licence

The starter is licenced as MIT, you can read the full [licence here](/licence.md).

## Payment

The template is free, but if you want to give me money, you can do it through [this link](https://paypal.me/javebratt). Contact me if you need an invoice to mark it as a business expense.

## Usage

I have built a tutorial that explains how to use this starter. You can find it in the [Firebase Authentication](https://courses.javebratt.com/course/authentication/intro) course on my [main course site](https://courses.javebratt.com/).
